# Phase 1: Base Building Guidelines

## Overview
**Duration**: 6 weeks  
**Focus**: Aerobic base development, injury prevention  
**Target Mileage**: 30 miles per week

## Training Structure

### Weekly Pattern
- **Easy Runs**: 5-6 days per week
- **Strides**: 2x per week (after easy runs)
- **Long Run**: 1x per week (Sunday)
- **Rest**: 1-2 days per week

### Key Principles
1. **Conversational Pace**: All running should be at easy, conversational effort
2. **Consistency Over Speed**: Focus on completing planned mileage
3. **Progressive Loading**: Gradually increase weekly volume
4. **Recovery Focus**: Listen to your body, prioritize sleep and nutrition

### Strides Protocol
- **Frequency**: Twice per week (typically Tuesday and Thursday)
- **Timing**: After easy runs when legs are warmed up
- **Distance**: 80-100 meters each
- **Count**: 6-8 strides per session
- **Effort**: Gradually accelerate to near R pace, then relax
- **Recovery**: Walk back to start (full recovery)
- **Focus**: Smooth acceleration, good form, relaxed finish

### Weekly Mileage Progression
- Week 1: 28-30 miles
- Week 2: 30-32 miles
- Week 3: 32-34 miles
- Week 4: 28-30 miles (recovery week)
- Week 5: 34-36 miles
- Week 6: 30-32 miles + Phase 1 Time Trial

## Success Criteria
- Complete all planned easy runs at appropriate effort
- Execute strides with good form and appropriate pace
- Maintain injury-free training
- Feel energized and ready for Phase 2 quality work
- Establish consistent weekly mileage baseline

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Running easy runs too fast ("junk miles")
- Skipping strides or doing them at wrong effort
- Increasing mileage too aggressively
- Ignoring early signs of overuse injury
- Neglecting sleep and recovery

## Transition to Phase 2
At the end of Phase 1, you should feel:
- Comfortable with target weekly mileage
- Eager for more challenging workouts
- Injury-free and energetic
- Ready to handle tempo runs and intervals
