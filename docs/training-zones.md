# Training Zones - Jack Daniels System

## Zone Definitions

### Easy (E) Pace
- **Purpose**: Aerobic base building, recovery
- **Effort**: Conversational pace, should feel comfortable
- **Heart Rate**: 65-79% of max HR
- **Typical Use**: Daily training runs, long runs, recovery

### Marathon (M) Pace
- **Purpose**: Improve running economy, lactate clearance
- **Effort**: Comfortably hard, sustainable for 2+ hours
- **Heart Rate**: 80-89% of max HR
- **Typical Use**: Tempo portions of long runs, marathon-specific work

### Threshold (T) Pace
- **Purpose**: Improve lactate threshold, tempo work
- **Effort**: Comfortably hard for 20-40 minutes
- **Heart Rate**: 88-92% of max HR
- **Typical Use**: Tempo runs, cruise intervals

### Interval (I) Pace
- **Purpose**: Improve VO2 max, running power
- **Effort**: Hard but sustainable for 3-8 minutes
- **Heart Rate**: 95-100% of max HR
- **Typical Use**: 800m-1600m repeats with recovery

### Repetition (R) Pace
- **Purpose**: Improve speed, running economy, anaerobic power
- **Effort**: Very hard, 30 seconds to 2 minutes
- **Heart Rate**: Not reliable at this intensity
- **Typical Use**: 200m-400m repeats with full recovery

## Strides
- **Purpose**: Neuromuscular activation, form improvement
- **Distance**: 80-100 meters
- **Effort**: Gradually accelerate to near R pace, then relax
- **Recovery**: Full recovery between repetitions
- **Frequency**: 2x per week during base phase

## Notes
- All paces should be adjusted for weather, terrain, and fatigue
- Focus on effort rather than strict pace adherence
- Recovery between intervals is as important as the work itself
